INIT: Init node to 0, all other nodes to INF

distance[i] (i is node index)

1) Mark initial node as current. All other nodes unvisited. Create
	set of these nodes
	
2)  For current node, calculate all distances of neighbor nodes to this
	node. If any of these are less than the current, assign it.
	
3)  Mark current node visited and remove from unvisited set.

4)  If dest node has been visited stop.

5)  Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with smallest
	distance and set it as new current node.
